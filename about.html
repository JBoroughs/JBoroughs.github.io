        The first calendars that we have records of was in the Bronze age. This was known as the Sumerian Calendar which was followed by many others such as Egyptian, Assryian, and Elamite Calendars. Calendars started to be used more around the iron age according to the Babylonian Calendars. More Calendars new to this era were The calendar of the Persian empire and the Zoroastrin calendar. The Roman Calenar was formed by Julius Caesar in 45 BCE  Calendars in the past were usually lunisolar, whcih meant that they all relied on observation to predict what was going to happen. Onece the Roman calendar was invented it brought a new way so that it wasn't all based on observation any more, instead the calendar introduced a leap year ever four years. In Persia during the 11th century Khayyam announced that the length of year was measured as 365.24219858156 days. The sixth decimal place changes over a persons lifetime so it is bizarre that they got it this accurate. To compare them today the length is 365.24219 days.
